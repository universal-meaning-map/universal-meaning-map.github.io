It is not an assertion of complete identity but an acknowledgment of the object's relevant patterns. For example, stating \"The banana is a fruit\" recognizes the banana's fruit-like patterns without claiming it only embodies those patterns. This use of \"is\" reflects a simplified narrative, acknowledging that objects possess many other patterns not captured in such statements.</p> <p>Objects in the UMM Framework are any conceptual or physical entities that exhibit patterns. These patterns are repetitive information sets across dimensions, but they may not always be precisely defined due to language limitations and the presence of discernable-but-not-definable patterns.</p> <p>Understanding an object's essence is a process of meaning-making, limited by language and the need for semantic boundaries. The term \"is\" thus becomes a tool for navigating and making sense of the object's expressed patterns, while recognizing the impossibility of defining it in absolute terms. It encapsulates the selective narratives that describe an object's reality, highlighting the constraints of language and the fallacy of narratives as objective truths.</p>"},{"location":"framework/what-is-umm-how-umm-understands-information-why-is-being-able-to-redefine-what-something-is-so-important-why-we-as-humans-deserve-a-new-information-system/","title":"An Intro to Umm","text":"<p>Umm, short for \"Universal Meaning Map,\" is an innovative system designed to enhance how information is structured and understood. It focuses on meaning as the primary information unit, aiming to create a more intuitive interaction between humans and computers. Umm's understanding of information relies on \"meaning-units,\" which are dynamic and evolve with new experiences, ensuring knowledge representation remains fluid and current.</p> <p>Redefining these meaning-units is vital for two reasons:</p> <ul> <li>It refines semantic boundaries, improving understanding and mirroring the continuous nature of reality.</li> <li>It counters the notion that narratives are absolute truths, recognizing the subjective construction of meaning.</li> </ul> <p>The need for Umm stems from the inadequacies of traditional information systems, which often distort information due to mediator incentives and context loss. Umm's user-centric design prioritizes individual intent and meaning, offering a tailored approach to information management.</p> <p>Humans require an information system like Umm that can match their cognitive complexity, overcoming language limitations and communication challenges. Umm's focus on meaning and adaptability presents a solution that aligns with human cognitive needs, promoting a deeper and more sophisticated engagement with information.</p>"}]}
