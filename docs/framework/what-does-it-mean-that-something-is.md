# Everything an object can be

In the UMM Framework, the term "is" signifies the alignment of an object's patterns with the characteristics of a concept. It is not an assertion of complete identity but an acknowledgment of the object's relevant patterns. For example, stating "The banana is a fruit" recognizes the banana's fruit-like patterns without claiming it only embodies those patterns. This use of "is" reflects a simplified narrative, acknowledging that objects possess many other patterns not captured in such statements.

Objects in the UMM Framework are any conceptual or physical entities that exhibit patterns. These patterns are repetitive information sets across dimensions, but they may not always be precisely defined due to language limitations and the presence of discernable-but-not-definable patterns.

Understanding an object's essence is a process of meaning-making, limited by language and the need for semantic boundaries. The term "is" thus becomes a tool for navigating and making sense of the object's expressed patterns, while recognizing the impossibility of defining it in absolute terms. It encapsulates the selective narratives that describe an object's reality, highlighting the constraints of language and the fallacy of narratives as objective truths.
