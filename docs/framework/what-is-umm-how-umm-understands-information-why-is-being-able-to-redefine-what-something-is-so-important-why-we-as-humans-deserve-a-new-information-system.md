# An Intro to Umm

Umm, short for "Universal Meaning Map," is an innovative system designed to enhance how information is structured and understood. It focuses on meaning as the primary information unit, aiming to create a more intuitive interaction between humans and computers. Umm's understanding of information relies on "meaning-units," which are dynamic and evolve with new experiences, ensuring knowledge representation remains fluid and current.

Redefining these meaning-units is vital for two reasons:

- It refines semantic boundaries, improving understanding and mirroring the continuous nature of reality.
- It counters the notion that narratives are absolute truths, recognizing the subjective construction of meaning.

The need for Umm stems from the inadequacies of traditional information systems, which often distort information due to mediator incentives and context loss. Umm's user-centric design prioritizes individual intent and meaning, offering a tailored approach to information management.

Humans require an information system like Umm that can match their cognitive complexity, overcoming language limitations and communication challenges. Umm's focus on meaning and adaptability presents a solution that aligns with human cognitive needs, promoting a deeper and more sophisticated engagement with information.
