Umm aims to create an information system that simulates the internal model of reality of its user.

It has its own model of cognition designed to be able to be mapped into digital primitives that can emulate the full spectrum cognitive abstraction that each of us use to model the world.

Because an internal model encompasses everything that a human cares about, this information system must be unmediated and protected from incentives that may compromise it.

This site is a work in progress, but within the next weeks I'll start sharing a series of articles around computation, language and perception... with the end goal to formalize a model for how to represent meaning digitally.
