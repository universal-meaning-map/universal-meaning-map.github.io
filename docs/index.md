Umm aims to create an information system that emulates the internal model of reality of its user.

It defines new models of cognition and biological computation (Umm framework) with the aim of mapping them into digital primitives that can emulate the full spectrum cognitive abstraction that each of us use in the analog world.

Because an internal model encompasses everything that a human cares about, this information system must be unmediated and protected from incentives that may compromise it.

Umm.earth aims to progressively share the Umm framework, so it can be questioned and iterated upon, so finally we can build the tool.
